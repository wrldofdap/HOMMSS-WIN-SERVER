# Security Recommendations

This document provides security recommendations for the HOMMSS-PHP application.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

1. **Package Vulnerabilities**:
   - Updated league/commonmark to version 2.7.0 to fix XSS vulnerability (CVE-2025-46734)

2. **Hardcoded Credentials**:
   - Removed hardcoded backup password in SecureBackupDatabase.php
   - Removed sensitive credentials from .env.example
   - Added proper password validation in backup/restore commands

3. **Security Headers**:
   - Added Content Security Policy (CSP) header
   - Added Permissions Policy header
   - Removed deprecated X-XSS-Protection header

4. **SQL Injection Protection**:
   - Fixed potential SQL injection in HomeController search method
   - Implemented proper parameter binding for database queries

5. **Debug Mode**:
   - Disabled debug mode in production environment

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Configuration

1. **Environment Files**:
   - Keep `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control
   - Use `.env.example` as a template without sensitive information
   - Set `APP_DEBUG=false` in production environments

2. **API Keys and Credentials**:
   - Store all sensitive credentials in the `.env` file
   - Rotate API keys and credentials regularly
   - Use environment-specific credentials for different environments

### Code Security

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all user input using Laravel's validation system
   - Use type hinting and strict type checking
   - Sanitize output to prevent XSS attacks

2. **Database Security**:
   - Use Laravel's query builder or Eloquent to prevent SQL injection
   - Use parameter binding for all database queries
   - Implement proper database access controls

3. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Enforce strong password policies
   - Implement multi-factor authentication where possible
   - Use Laravel's authorization system (Gates and Policies)

4. **File Uploads**:
   - Validate file types, sizes, and content
   - Store uploaded files outside the web root
   - Use Laravel's storage system for file management

### Server Security

1. **Web Server Configuration**:
   - Keep web server software updated
   - Configure proper HTTPS settings
   - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

2. **Database Backups**:
   - Encrypt database backups
   - Store backups securely
   - Test backup restoration regularly

3. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Monitor application logs for suspicious activity
   - Implement centralized logging
   - Set up alerts for security events

## Security Scanning

A security scanning script has been added to help identify potential security issues:

```bash
./security-scan.sh
```

This script checks for:
- Composer vulnerabilities
- Hardcoded credentials
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities
- File inclusion vulnerabilities
- Command injection vulnerabilities
- Debug mode settings

Run this script regularly to identify potential security issues.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to the administrator at [admin@example.com](mailto:admin@example.com). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.
